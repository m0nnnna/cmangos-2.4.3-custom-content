I'm going to put the things that I make that are "done" but show off what they do.

>Helpful Demon Creature 190014 <-- creature_template<
Creates an NPC at the entry ID 190014 is already configured to be a succubus and vendor.

>Helpful Demon Vendor 190013 <-- vendor_template<
Actually makes the above a vendor. Note that once created in NPC_VENDOR you need to add the item you want to sell to the vendor ID.

>Windfury Potion Item 39657 <-- item_template<
Creates an item that adds Windfury to your weapon. It is a potion and it is a consume.
